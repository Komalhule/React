              Apart from being a web developer, I enjoy most of my time being
              outdoors. On weekdays I go for walks daily. I also enjoy trekking,
              exploring local cuisines and blogging.

              When forced indoors, I follow a number of sci-fi and fantasy genre
              movies and television shows, I am an aspiring blogger, and I spend a
              large amount of my free time exploring the latest technology
              advancements in the front-end web development world.
